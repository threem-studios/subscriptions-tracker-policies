<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>

<p>
This Privacy Policy applies to the Subscriptions Tracker app (the "Application") for Android mobile devices, developed by ThreeM Studios (the "Service Provider"). The Application is provided as a freemium service with optional in-app subscriptions and is intended for use "AS IS".
</p>

<br>

<strong>Information Collection and Use</strong>

<p>
The Application is designed with privacy in mind and collects <strong>no personally identifiable information</strong>.
</p>

<p>
Any data you enter into the Application, such as subscription names, categories, costs, billing cycles, renewal dates, notes, or reminder settings, is stored <strong>locally on your device only</strong>. This data is not transmitted to, stored on, or accessible by the Service Provider.
</p>

<p>
The Application may request the following permissions:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Notification permission</strong> – used solely to send subscription renewal reminders that you configure within the app</li>
</ul>

<p>
The Application does <strong>not</strong> collect or track:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Names, email addresses, or contact information</li>
  <li>Device identifiers, IP addresses, or precise location data</li>
  <li>Usage analytics, tracking data, or behavioral profiles</li>
</ul>

<br>

<strong>In-App Subscriptions</strong>

<p>
The Application offers optional monthly and yearly subscriptions that unlock additional features or higher usage limits.
</p>

<p>
All subscription payments are processed securely by the Google Play Store using Google Play Billing. The Service Provider does not receive, store, or have access to your payment information.
</p>

<p>
Subscription status (such as whether a subscription is active) is managed through Google Play services and may be temporarily cached on your device to enable or disable premium features.
</p>

<br>

<strong>Third-Party Access</strong>

<p>
The Application does not share user data with third parties.
</p>

<p>
Google Play services may process limited technical information as required to handle app distribution, subscriptions, and purchases, in accordance with Google’s own privacy policies.
</p>

<br>

<strong>Opt-Out Rights</strong>

<p>
You may stop using the Application at any time by uninstalling it. All locally stored data will be removed when the Application is uninstalled.
</p>

<p>
You may also disable notifications at any time through your device’s system settings.
</p>

<br>

<strong>Children’s Privacy</strong>

<p>
The Application does not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from anyone, including children under the age of 13.
</p>

<p>
Because no personal data is collected or transmitted, the Application complies with applicable children’s privacy regulations by design.
</p>

<br>

<strong>Security</strong>

<p>
All data is stored locally on your device and protected by Android’s standard security mechanisms. The Service Provider does not operate external servers or databases containing user data.
</p>

<br>

<strong>Changes to This Privacy Policy</strong>

<p>
This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page. Continued use of the Application after changes indicates acceptance of the updated policy.

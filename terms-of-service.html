<strong>Terms &amp; Conditions</strong>

<p>
These Terms and Conditions apply to the Subscriptions Tracker app (the "Application") for Android mobile devices, developed by ThreeM Studios (the "Service Provider"). The Application is provided as a freemium service with optional in-app subscriptions and is intended for use "AS IS".
</p>

<br>

<p>
By downloading or using the Application, you agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions. If you do not agree with any part of these terms, you should discontinue use of the Application.
</p>

<br>

<strong>Use of the Application</strong>

<p>
The Application is designed to help users track recurring subscriptions, expenses, and renewal dates, and to receive reminder notifications based on information entered by the user. The Application is intended for personal, non-commercial use only.
</p>

<p>
You acknowledge that the Application provides organizational tools and reminders only and does not provide financial, legal, accounting, or tax advice. You remain solely responsible for managing your subscriptions, verifying charges, and cancelling services with third-party providers.
</p>

<p>
You agree not to misuse the Application, including attempting to copy, modify, distribute, reverse engineer, decompile, or create derivative works from the Application or any part of it.
</p>

<p>
All trademarks, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights related to the Application remain the exclusive property of the Service Provider.
</p>

<br>

<strong>Notifications</strong>

<p>
The Application may request permission to send notifications in order to remind you of upcoming subscription renewals or billing events.
</p>

<p>
The Service Provider does not guarantee that notifications will always be delivered on time or at all. Notification delivery may be affected by device settings, operating system behavior, battery optimization, notification permissions, or other factors outside the Service Provider’s control.
</p>

<br>

<strong>Subscriptions and Payments</strong>

<p>
The Application offers optional monthly and yearly subscriptions that unlock premium features or higher usage limits.
</p>

<p>
All payments are processed securely through the Google Play Store using Google Play Billing. The Service Provider does not process, store, or have access to your payment information.
</p>

<p>
Subscription management, renewals, cancellations, and refunds are handled entirely by Google Play and are subject to Google Play’s terms and policies.
</p>

<br>

<strong>User Data</strong>

<p>
All data entered into the Application, such as subscription details, costs, billing cycles, and reminder settings, is stored locally on your device. The Service Provider does not collect, transmit, or store user data on external servers.
</p>

<p>
You are responsible for maintaining the security of your device and access to the Application. The Service Provider strongly advises against rooting, jailbreaking, or otherwise modifying your device, as doing so may compromise security and cause the Application to malfunction.
</p>

<br>

<strong>Availability and Functionality</strong>

<p>
The Application is intended to function primarily offline. Certain features, such as subscription validation or entitlement checks, may require an internet connection.
</p>

<p>
The Service Provider does not guarantee that the Application will be compatible with all devices, manufacturers, or future versions of the Android operating system.
</p>

<p>
The Service Provider reserves the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue any part of the Application at any time without prior notice.
</p>

<br>

<strong>Limitation of Liability</strong>

<p>
To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Service Provider shall not be liable for any loss, missed payments, unexpected charges, subscription renewals, fees, interest, data loss, or other damages resulting from the use of or inability to use the Application.
</p>

<p>
The Application relies on user-provided data and system-level notification mechanisms, which may fail or behave unpredictably. You acknowledge and accept these limitations.
</p>

<br>

<strong>Changes to These Terms</strong>

<p>
The Service Provider may update these Terms and Conditions from time to time. Any changes will be effective upon posting. Continued use of the Application after changes indicates acceptance of the updated terms.
</p>

<br>

<strong>Termination</strong>

<p>
The Service Provider may terminate or suspend access to the Application at any time, without notice, if you violate these Terms and Conditions.
</p>

<br>

<strong>Governing Law</strong>

<p>
These Terms and Conditions shall be governed by and construed in accordance with applicable laws, without regard to conflict of law principles.
</p>
